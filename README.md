# Final-Project-Quiz
This code is what I am using for my final project for my C++ coding class.
The project that I have created is a quiz type of game. It will display which question you are on, and the possible answers, then get input on which answer you think is correct. The possible answers will be listed in arrays, questions and answers will be written as strings. There will also be a score counter to keep track of how many they got correct. I want to make it very easy to read and change the code if I want to make the questions or answers any different.
I am directing this project to people who want to teach, and to people who want to learn. This quiz can be used by many people who are trying to teach others what they need to know, especially in a school scenario. I will make the code easy to read and edit so teachers will be able to change what they need to have this quiz fit what they need for their class. They will be able to test kids on what they know, and find problems that they missed, and show what the teacher should work on.
This code will simply ask you questions, that you will answer, and it will tell you how many of them you got correct.
This code can be run with no extra downloads, except for a simple code runner.
To use this code simply run it while inside your code runner, then it will start asking you your first question.
