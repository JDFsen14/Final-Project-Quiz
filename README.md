# Final-Project-Quiz
This code is what I am using for my final project for my C++ coding class.
It is a small quiz type code, that I am mainly using as a school class study guide.
This code will simply ask you questions, that you will answer, and it will tell you how many of them you got correct.
This code can be run with no extra downloads, except for a simple code runner.
To use this code simply run it while inside your code runner, then it will start asking you your first question.
